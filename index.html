<p>
Though the connections between programming languages and mathematics, logic, and philosophy are perhaps best-known,
a growing body of research has established connections with creative domains, including both liberal arts (linguistics) and fine arts (music, fiber crafts, live stage performance, visual art).
</p>

<p>
Programming language technologies have proven their impact in creative industries.
Starting with early programmable automation, like the Jacquard loom, programming remains essential to the textile industry, often through computer-aided design applications.
In live arts, musicians and stage performers use code as an instrument.
Programming is a vital tool, particularly in interactive digital media, for generating visual art content at scale.
At the same time, academics have proposed new theoretical foundations for programming across these domains:
refinement types for music,
topology and homotopy type theory for fabric crafts,
logic programming for procedural content generation.
However, these applied and foundational developments have largely occurred in isolation from one another.

<div class="focus">

<p><em>Meeting focus:</em>
The focus of this meeting is to build a bridge between foundational and applied scholarship on programming languages for creative domains such as the liberal and fine arts.
We will address the following three research questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>RQ1: How can foundational techniques support creativity?</em>
<p>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<em>RQ2: What opportunities arise from the unique aspects of creative programming?</em>
<p>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<em>RQ3: How can techniques from creative fields inform development of general-purpose programming languages?</em>
<p>
</p>
</li>

</ul>
